# When to `mutate` and `mutateAsync`

I was reviewing a GitLab MR and added a comment with this piece example

```js
const onSubmit = async (data) => {
  // construct body
  const body = ...


  // call mutateAsync
  try {
    await mutateAsync(body, {
      onSuccess: (result) => {
        setResult(result)
        callback({
          success: true
        })
      }
    })
  } catch {
    setResult(null)
    callback({
      success: false
    })
  }
}
```

I suggested what if the code written like this

```js
try {
  const result = await mutateAsync(body)

  setResult(result)
  callback({
    success: true
  })
} catch { ... }
```

Then I started to think. Why there are `mutate` and `mutateAsync` ?. So, I was really curious and start Googling. I was ended up with good references from a web blog https://tkdodo.eu/blog/mastering-mutations-in-react-query#mutate-or-mutateasync that concludes:

Use `mutateAsync` if you need to compose multiple promise and handle the error in single catch. For example if you need to await the response and call other promise with that result or combine those multiple promise to run in parallel like:

```js
try {
  const result = await mutateAsync(body)

  const params = {
    user: result.id
    active: true
  }

  const updateUserResult = await mutateUpdateUserAsync(params)

  // other action that access result and updateUserResult
} catch {
  // show error on updating user
}

```

Other than this case it is enough to use `mutate`. So we don't need those `async` and `await` keyword.

```js
mutate(body, {
  onSuccess() {

  }
  onError() {

  }
})

```
