# About Me

Hi!, I'm Egi Hasdi, a Software Engineer based in Indonesia. I currently work at [GovTech Edu Indonesia](https://www.govtechedu.id/) as a web Frontend Developer, where I focus on delivering high-scale web application for integrated system in higher education.

This site is a space for storing my notes, primarily focused on software engineering topics, with the aim of growing it into a Digital Garden. It's inspired by [SÃ©bastien Dubois' Public Notes](https://notes.dsebastien.net/50+Resources/56+Obsidian+Publish/README). This site is built using [Lume](https://lume.land/), the static site generator for Deno, and all notes are written and organized in Markdown format with [Obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim). This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/egihasdi/egihasdi.github.io).

If you'd like to dive into my notes, feel free to to start here: [Home Notes](/home)
