# Reading Journal

I sometime want to revisit article I read in the past. I think listing article links here will help me:

- 2024-11-15: [A day in the life of an indie developer dad](https://www.devas.life/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-parenting-solo-developer/)
- 2024-11-15: [Tech stack lessons from my 7+ year indie dev journey](https://www.devas.life/tech-choices-for-continuing-indie-development-for-over-7-years/)
