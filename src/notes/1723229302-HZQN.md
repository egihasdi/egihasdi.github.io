# Thinking in the Quest-oriented Way

I stumbled upon an article listed on HN titled "Do Quests, not Goals". The word "Quest" made me curious enough to get me to the post page and read it enthusiastically. It reminds me to the day when I play games a lot. Those days when I play RPG games such as "Final Fantasy", "Legend of Mana", "Brigandine" was unforgettable. Those games have some "Quests" and it was really fun to follow as it uncover exciting story. I was willing to spent many hours to follow thoroughly quest by quest. In the other side, I felt sad when it came to the end as I wanted to have more quest and story to follow.
