# GIT: Reverting a File To Previous Commit

First, check the file commits log using this command

```bash
git log --oneline -- theFileWantToReverted.js

```

Note the commit hash you want to revert to and checkout

```bash
git checkout 55ad1xxx -- theFileWantToReverted.js
```

Then you can commit and push.
It is useful when the file is modified by linter and you don't want it to be conflicted with other commit in a Merge Request
