# Hi, folks!

This site is intended to store my notes about Software Engineering stuff and grow it for my Personal Knowledge Management. It is built on top of [Lume](https://lume.land/) the static site generator for Deno. All my notes are organized and created in markdown format using [Obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim). This site is hosted in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/egihasdi/egihasdi.github.io).

Finally, if you want to read some of my notes you can start here: [My Notes](/notes/0000000000-HOME)
